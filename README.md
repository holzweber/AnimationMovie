Here a boat trip trough Linz(countryside) is designed. The boat will - not as usual - trip in water, but it will take a nice trip
through Linz on the street. This is possible, because our boat has wheels.
The ship will at a certain point jump, because there is an obstacle (ramp) on the road.
After some more travelling  it will be on fire, because our torch, which helps to driver to see everything as a lightsource, will fall.(shot by cannonball)
After this massive 30seconds trip, our ship will be destroyed.

Afterwards it will be possible to freely move through the scene.

Implemented with Visual Code - implement the "Go Live" Plugin for starting the video easily
